Artificial cognition: Project Canvas
--------------------

In my personal time, I've been working toward
providing machines with adaptability, imagination, and
intelligence. The emphasis is on developing general proto-intelligence
first, with the firm belief that optimizing the system for
domain-specific applications doesn't serve that goal.

Structural bioinformatics
-------------------------

The SuMo project was an attempt to identify local similarities in
unrelated 3D structures of proteins, in the hope that they would share
a similar biological function.

This involved complex heuristics for somewhat limited results.
It permanently convinced me that a system capable of forming its own
intuition about the behavior of proteins would be the key to
solving this problem, and many others.
