My name is Martin Jambon and I'm a software engineer based in the San
Francisco Bay Area. In my personal time, I'm working on providing
autonomous machines with adaptability, imagination, and
intelligence.
The emphasis is on **generality first, applications later**.

I'm not sure how to present this research like I'm a sane
person. Many of the concepts I use were developed in private over the
years, and I'll be happy to go over them with you if you're interested
and patient.
For example, when I claim "perception, imagination, and intuition are
essentially the same", I use those terms with specific definitions
that relate to the structure of the system I'm developing.
Any such philosophical-sounding claim shall be implemented and observable
in the system. This is a core design principle for effective
engineering. It is based on the assumption that there's no magic in
cognition, i.e. that intelligence as we know it can be
implemented in a Turing machine. With that in mind, you can take a
look at the technical reports I made available, below.

Structural bioinformatics
-------------------------

The SuMo project was an attempt to identify local similarities in
unrelated 3D structures of proteins, in the hope that they would share
a similar biological function.

This involved complex heuristics for somewhat limited results.
It permanently convinced me that a system capable of forming its own
intuition about the behavior of proteins would be the key to
solving this problem, and many others.
