Artificial cognition
--

In my personal time, I’ve been working toward
providing machines with adaptability, imagination, and
intelligence. The emphasis is on developing general proto-intelligence
first, with the firm belief that optimizing the system for
domain-specific applications doesn’t serve that goal.

The implementation of the
[architecture laid out in 2016](2016-08-20-agi-project-status-2016) is
still ongoing as of 2020. It is now closed-source.

Proofs-of-concept
--

These original ideas come with some implementation that works, but aren't
widely known or used by many. Work would be needed to publicize them
or make them widely accessible.

* [ad](https://github.com/mjambon/ad) (2020): Validation and
  formatting of acyclic dictionaries. The goal is to allow thinkers to
  present their respective world views in a concise and unambiguous
  manner, without resorting to mathematical formalism.
* [unpurple](https://github.com/mjambon/purple-fringe) (2012):
  An algorithm for removing purple-fringe defects from
  photos. Available to all in GIMP via G'MIC.
* [dutop](https://github.com/mjambon/dutop) (2011): A command for
  identifying what subtrees take up the most space in a file
  system. Typically used when running into "no space left on device"
  errors.
* [wcl](https://github.com/mjambon/wcl) (2011): A command for
  estimating the number of lines of large files. Useful when dealing
  routinely with 100,000,000 records or more.

Notable open-source projects
--

These tools have been or were used professionally by multiple independent
users. They were all initiated by me, with or without support from
an employer.

* [atd](https://github.com/ahrefs/atd) (2010)
* [yojson](https://github.com/ocaml-community/yojson) (2010)
* [cppo](https://github.com/ocaml-community/cppo) (2009)
* [mikmatch](https://github.com/mjambon/mikmatch) (2004, defunct):
  extension of OCaml's ML-style pattern-matching syntax with
  regexps. Was based on Camlp4 which since has fallen from grace.

Structural bioinformatics (2000&ndash;2007)
--

The SuMo project was an attempt to identify local similarities in
unrelated 3D structures of proteins, in the hope that they would share
a similar biological function.

This involved complex heuristics for somewhat limited results.
It permanently convinced me that a system capable of forming its own
intuition about the behavior of proteins would be the key to
solving this problem, and many others.
