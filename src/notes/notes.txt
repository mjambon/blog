  * The title field is used in the table of contents i.e. the document that
    links to all the notes on one page. It also shows as the title of
    the page.
  * The date field is used to tell the reader when a note was first
    published. The format is YYYY-MM-DD.
- a blank line marks the beginning of the markdown document
- document content is markdown as understood by the rest of this site.

title: It doesn't matter what qualifies as art
date: 2022-09-04

It doesn't matter what qualifies as art. "art" isn't an absolute or
necessary concept, it's a label that may or may not make sense in a
given context. When a label stops making sense, obsessing over it is
madness.

title: Why do beliefs matter?
date: 2022-09-03

In my model of mind, beliefs are explicit (conscious) parts of the
world model that a mind maintains. They can be communicated or revised
as necessary and in that sense, they're no different from notes on
paper. So why do they matter? They're used like notes or any other
symbols that were planted in the environment as reminders of some
concepts. I view this "symbol planting" as a way to (re)populate the
imagination on demand. It could be your own imagination or the
imagination of others. It bypasses original sensing. For example, the
written description of a banana can substitute itself to the sight of
an actual banana. I see beliefs as imagination primers, and
imagination sets the context for (intuitive) decision making. That's
why it's important that beliefs or their communicated form be
sufficiently correct for the application at hand.
