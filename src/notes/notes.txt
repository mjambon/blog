<!-- This file gets split into a bunch of pages.
Format:
- document separator is three or more stars followed by slug: ***
  file-name
- fields 'title', 'date' follow in any order without blank lines:
  * The title field is used in the table of contents i.e. the document that
    links to all the notes on one page. It also shows as the title of
    the page.
  * The date field is used to tell the reader when a note was first
    published. The format is YYYY-MM-DD.
- a blank line marks the beginning of the markdown document
- document content is markdown as understood by the rest of this site.
  Title and date should not be repeated as they will be automatically
  inserted and formatted.
