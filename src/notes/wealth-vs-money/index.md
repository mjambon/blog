% Wealth vs. money


If you destroy someone's property, it decreases the world's total
wealth, whether you pay to fix the damage or you run away.

The distinction between wealth and money was never taught to me, let
alone in school. I don't know why. It's essential because the concept
of wealth holds even in a society without individual property.
