% The value of art


An example of [cheap but expert-level](expert-vs-professional) tools
are those involved with minimalistic crafts. For
those, the simplicity of the production process is an essential
feature of the product. In this class of products, the use of advanced
machines in the production process devalues the product. A product
is not just the final, functional piece but also its production
process and even the history of the production process. By buying a
product that's hand-made and fits in a particular culture and
tradition, one acquires a piece of cultural significance. That is, we
can tell stories about its origins. The more unique yet interesting
its story is, the higher a luxury or non-functional object can sell:

* mass production: not unique, low market value
* crafts: objects with interesting stories produced in low numbers
* art: objects with interesting and unique stories

Great art is the product of a unique and remarkable timeline, making it hard
to truly duplicate. It's relatively easy to duplicate the Mona Lisa, but the
resulting copies are worthless in comparison because they don't add
much to the history of art. However, discovering a new painting by
Leonardo da Vinci, even a mediocre one, would be a major event and
the painting would immediately have a great value.
