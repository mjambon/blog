% Cohesion by threat of mutual destruction


Claim: All societies emerge as groups of individuals that have the property
of _destructive equality_.

Definition: **destructive equality**: a group of individuals has the
property of destructive equality if and only if any member of the
group can destroy value faster than any other member
can produce something of equivalent value.

A society is therefore a mutually-beneficial association held together
by the persisting threat of destruction as a means of punishment for
violating the society's rules.

Examples:

* Intelligent animals such as elephants or chimpanzes aren't part of
  modern human society because they're no threat to humans.
* Slaves are not proper members of their master's society. However,
  once slaves become threats to their masters, possibly through
  gaining education, they're freed i.e. they're made members of the
  same society as their masters.

Consequences:

* Society rules exist to prevent threats of mutual destruction
  from realizing.
* In general, large wealth inequalities are still possible within the same
  society.
* As a consequence of mutual threats, a split in society cannot occur
  without the isolation of sub-populations. Conversely, the increase
  of communication between nations that were once considered separate
  societies results in the merging of those societies.
* There's a limit to how much value a society member can
  control. Multibillionaires are merely tolerated by other society
  members. If they were to abuse their power, others would organize
  to stop it by enforcing or creating new laws.
* Societies organized in multiple tiers or castes with different birth
  privileges tend to become more uniform as all members acquire the same
  education and means of revolt.
