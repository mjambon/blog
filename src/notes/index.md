### <a name="should-i-reply"></a>Should I reply?


Someone says something on social media. I want to reply. Should I
really reply?

Here's a decision diagram to help keep my
impulses in check:

### <a name="respect-is-earned"></a>Respect is earned


Tolerance can be imposed but respect is earned. Like love, it's not
something that can't be enforced with rules.

* Being respected is generally desirable.
* Being respected by everyone isn't necessary.
* You may fire someone for not respecting another employee but that
  won't make them respectful.
* You may avoid being fired due to leaders or laws that require
  tolerance but that won't earn you respect.
* Your enemies can respect you and still butcher you.
* Tolerance can be a default behavior toward strangers - and I would
  recommend it - but a relationship doesn't start with mutual
  respect. It starts with mere tolerance.
* Disrespect is simply the absence of respect. It doesn't imply hatred.

**tolerance**: intentional avoidance of destructive action<br>
**respect**: feeling of appreciation toward someone's behavior as in
  "I like what they do"<br>
**disrespect**: absence of respect<br>
**love**: feeling of appreciation toward a whole person rather than
  specific behavior<br>
**hatred**: feeling that someone should not be around (?)

### <a name="lasting-interest"></a>Lasting interest


A good painting for home is one that looks a little bit different each
time you look at it. Public space art displays - even museums - don't
have this requirement. It's often enough for them to be cool the first
time you see them and boring thereafter.

Repeated exposures to a movie or to a significant have the same
issue.

### <a name="the-value-of-art"></a>The value of art


An example of [cheap but expert-level](expert-vs-professional) tools
are those involved with minimalistic crafts. For
those, the simplicity of the production process is an essential
feature of the product. In this class of products, the use of advanced
machines in the production process devalues the product. A product
is not just the final, functional piece but also its production
process and even the history of the production process. By buying a
product that's hand-made and fits in a particular culture and
tradition, one acquires a piece of cultural significance. That is, we
can tell stories about its origins. The more unique yet interesting
its story is, the higher a luxury or non-functional object can sell:

* mass production: not unique, low market value
* crafts: objects with interesting stories produced in low numbers
* art: objects with interesting and unique stories

Great art is the product of a unique and remarkable timeline, making it hard
to truly duplicate. It's relatively easy to duplicate the Mona Lisa, but the
resulting copies are worthless in comparison because they don't add
much to the history of art. However, discovering a new painting by
Leonardo da Vinci, even a mediocre one, would be a major event and
the painting would immediately have a great value.

### <a name="expert-vs-professional"></a>Expert vs. professional


When buying supplies for a new craft, you'll find products under four
broad kinds of labels:

* beginner
* expert
* cheap
* professional

One might think that "expert" and "professional" are the same but they
can actually be opposites. An expert is someone with advanced skills
who's able to take advantage of tools that are too tricky for a
beginner. On the other hand, a professional is someone who makes money
from their craft and can afford supplies that makes their work
easier. Therefore, a beginner with money might prefer
professional-grade tools as long as they're not only suitable for
experts.

Naturally, using two different labels to advertise products
goes in the way of effective marketing, which prefers simpler
formulas. For the customer, the recipe is simple: if you can afford
it, buy professional-grade supplies. Of course you'll have to make
sure that they indeed make your work easier.
Now, there is the other dimension -
beginner vs. expert. While some tools may be cheaper, they may only be
suited to experts. An extreme example and metaphor is bicycle training
wheels. Here, an expert - an ordinary bicycle rider - doesn't need to
buy training wheels. Riding without training wheels is faster and cheaper.
In that case, the expert-level product is no product at all. Not many
actual products fall into the cheap-product-for-experts category,
though, because experts are often also professionals who can afford
and will pay for better tools.

### <a name="theres-no-correct-perception"></a>There's no correct perception


There's no correct perception, only useful perception.

The interpretation of sensory input - perception - is a process that
generates concepts in a given context. Elements of context that
influence perception include:

- genetics of the individual mind
- history, culture, and specific events the mind went through
- current state of mind
- health, alertness, physical trauma
- psychoactive drugs

Perception is imagination primed with sensory input. Too little
imagination and no useful concept or abstraction emerges. Too much
imagination and the concepts are no longer relevant to the surrounding
environment. In both cases, the consequence is the failure to take on
actions that benefit the mind's body.

### <a name="it-doesnt-matter-what-qualifies-as-art"></a>It doesn't matter what qualifies as art


It doesn't matter what qualifies as art. "art" isn't an absolute or
necessary concept, it's a label that may or may not make sense in a
given context. When a label stops making sense, obsessing over it is
madness.

### <a name="why-beliefs-matter"></a>Why do beliefs matter?


In my model of mind, beliefs are explicit (conscious) parts of the
world model that a mind maintains. They can be communicated or revised
as necessary and in that sense, they're no different from notes on
paper. So why do they matter? They're used like notes or any other
symbols that were planted in the environment as reminders of some
concepts. I view this "symbol planting" as a way to (re)populate the
imagination on demand. It could be your own imagination or the
imagination of others. It bypasses original sensing. For example, the
written description of a banana can substitute itself to the sight of
an actual banana. I see beliefs as imagination primers, and
imagination sets the context for (intuitive) decision making. That's
why it's important that beliefs or their communicated form be
sufficiently correct for the application at hand.

### <a name="own-your-sh-t"></a>Own your sh*t


Own your sh\*t. It's called sh\*t for a reason. It's your legacy and
it's not perfect. It never is.

Justification:

Society emerges from the recognition of individuals. An individual is
located in space and time. More than this, it is tied to a sphere of
influence. We assigne causes to events and we stop in the chain when
hitting a decision center - the mind of an individual. For example, a
recognized causality chain would be:

global warming<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
excessive CO$_2$ emissions<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
bad governance of world countries<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
leaders of world countries<br>
⇑ elections ???<br>
citizens

It's generally the leaders of the countries that are held responsible, not the
citizens that put them in power.

Individual members of society are considered responsible for their
actions, or they're not members of society. This is how various
societies have emerged throughout history. sometimes, some individuals
are considered less responsible than others but nonetheless, it's hard
to find cases where someone else is held responsible instead. Examples
of classes of people that have been historically considered less
responsible include:

* slaves
* minors
* women
* ethnic groups, casts
* unintelligent people

While there's no scientific reason why the world must be comprised of
one or more societies, it is the framework within which humans
operate. It follows from the emergence of individuals minds although
it's not necessary. Many animals arguably have minds but are not
meaningfully organized as societies. Even a human, when stranded alone
on a desert island, ceases to function within a society. Another
class of scenarios with unclear consequences involve hive minds. A
hive mind a spatially distributed, which may temporarily be split into
individual minds due to communication network failures but eventually
reconnects. It is what humans might turn into if they became
telepathically connected, possibly using brain implants and wireless
communication networks. We don't have historical evidence of actual
hive minds to have a clear sense of how responsibility and justice
would be implemented in such societies, if we may still call them
societies. We could speculate that hive minds tend to not be
competitive in the world and die out precisely due to the lack of blame
assignment to their individual constituents, as well as the lack of
competition between multiple hive minds if they keep merging into
bigger hive minds on first contact. This is to say that a hive mind
may not be evolutionary competitive unless it implements some
mechanism that guarantees its evolution and survival in changing
environment. This is a concern when one considers that the major
contributor to the evolution of intelligence in humans may have been
intraspecific conflict, i.e. war. Modern communication technology may
be bringing humans closer to functioning as a hive mind. However, we
still operate as a society with well-defined individuals, and we have
laws and traditions based on that. Historically, efforts to assign or
deassign responsibility from actual decision centers - the individual
minds - have failed massively. See for example dictatorships or
attempts to create pure collectivist societies where everyone is
equally deserving regardless of they do.

### <a name="causality-doesnt-exist"></a>Causality doesn't exist


Causality doesn't exist in the scientific sense. While it's present in
many useful models, it is always possible to extend the model without
respecting the causality relationships.

Causality is usually of this form:

* Two categories of events are recognized.
* An event is a state of the system at a point in time.
* The events occur within a time (range) from one another with some
  statistical correlation.
* The event occurring first is said to cause the event that occurs
  earlier.
