### <a name="settling-the-liar-paradox"></a>Settling the liar's paradox


The liar's paradox is the problem of interpreting a sentence uttered
by someone who never tells the truth, in which they claim they're
not telling the truth.

The paradox comes from the confusion between truth and
belief. Consider the following:

- Like anyone else, a liar has beliefs and they may or may not be true.
- A liar is someone who produces sentences which are not their beliefs.

Therefore, the truthfulness of a statement is independent from
whether the person making them is lying. The common phrase
"tell the truth" is a misnomer and should be instead
"state your belief".

When someone makes a statement, it is assumed that they
express one of their beliefs. In the case of a liar, this assumption is
incorrect. We could check this if we had a perfect lie detector that
reads their mind.

A given statement is characterized by a pair (believed?,
true?). The first value indicates whether the author believes the
statement:

- believed (B)
- disbelieved (D)
- agnostic (A): neither believed nor disbelieved

The second value indicates whether the statement is true in a **model of
reference** consisting of a deductive system accompanied with the set
of statements that were either proven or disproven:

- true (T): we have a proof for the statement
- false (F): we have a proof of its negation
- other (O): we don't have a proof, for whatever reason

This gives us nine categories of statements. Highlighted statements
are the most commonly encountered:

- **[B, T]** the honest expression of a correct belief;
- **[B, F]** mistake: the honest expression of an incorrect belief;
- **[B, O]** genuine discovery, false discovery, or expression of
  faith: the honest expression of a belief that was neither proven nor
  disproven in the model of reference;
- **[D, F]** ordinary lie: a statement that their author believes to be
  false and is indeed false;
- [D, T] correct lie: statement that their author believes to be false but
  is in fact true.
- [D, O] malicious misguidance: a statement that their authors believes to be
  false but was neither proven nor disproven in the model of
  reference;
- [A, F], [A, T], [A, O]: a type of lie for which the author doesn't
  know the truth but pretends they do and make something up.
  It could be made in an effort to appear confident in front of a
  particular audience.

The liar's paradox is now settled. There are two steps to the story:

1. The liar forms a belief which is "I'm not lying (for the thing
   I'm about to say)".
2. The liar expresses the negation of that belief, "I'm lying",
   because they're still a liar and old habits die hard.
   This can be verified by the lie detector.
   Their belief was incorrect. Their statement is correct by chance.
   This is the unusual case [D, T] above, a correct lie.

Since we just settled the liar's paradox, we might as well settle the
meaning of truth.

**truth**: whether a statement was proven within a model of reference taken
to be universal. Science is the activity conducted by a society, such as
humanity, that builds such a world model. This model gets revised
and extended over time by reconciliating it with other models derived from
experimental observations and computations. In practice, there's not a unique
place where our universal model is written unambiguously.
Even if we decided the exact collection of books and articles that compose it,
it would contain inconsistencies due to various types of mistakes,
approximations, and guesses. However, it would also contain a lot
of redundancy, allowing certain statements to be considered more reliable
than others. Those are what we call the truth in ordinary speech.

There is no absolute truth, only models.

### <a name="cohesion-by-threat-of-mutual-destruction"></a>Cohesion by threat of mutual destruction


Claim: All societies emerge as groups of individuals that have the property
of _destructive equality_.

Definition: **destructive equality**: a group of individuals has the
property of destructive equality if and only if any member of the
group can destroy value faster than any other member
can produce something of equivalent value.

A society is therefore a mutually-beneficial association held together
by the persisting threat of destruction as a means of punishment for
violating the society's rules.

Examples:

* Intelligent animals such as elephants or chimpanzes aren't part of
  modern human society because they're no threat to humans.
* Slaves are not proper members of their master's society. However,
  once slaves become threats to their masters, possibly through
  gaining education, they're freed i.e. they're made members of the
  same society as their masters.

Consequences:

* Society rules exist to prevent threats of mutual destruction
  from realizing.
* In general, large wealth inequalities are still possible within the same
  society.
* As a consequence of mutual threats, a split in society cannot occur
  without the isolation of sub-populations. Conversely, the increase
  of communication between nations that were once considered separate
  societies results in the merging of those societies.
* There's a limit to how much value a society member can
  control. Multibillionaires are merely tolerated by other society
  members. If they were to abuse their power, others would organize
  to stop it by enforcing or creating new laws.
* Societies organized in multiple tiers or castes with different birth
  privileges tend to become more uniform as all members acquire the same
  education and means of revolt.

### <a name="why-does-anything-exist"></a>Why does anything exist?


Since at least the reader of this text exists, something exists. Isn't
that great? Now, why do things exist? It must be costly to create
things out of nothing. Maybe that's okay because something has
always existed. Here are some ideas relating to the question of why
anything exists.

#### Idea 1: God created the world

This one is listed only because it's popular. Obviously, it doesn't
help us at all because it doesn't explain why a creator exists in the
first place.

#### Idea 2: The world is random

Here, we consider that the information contained in the world grows
over time because the world is the product of a random data generator
that underlies everything. This theory assumes some fundamental notion
of time and an origin of time where the world starts from nothing and
gets more complex as random data or "matter" gets produced. This
theory feels satisfying when we consider the existence of an initial
state containing zero information. It is dubious for other reasons:

* Like for the god hypothesis, it doesn't explain why a random data
  generator would exist in the first place.
* This model assumes time and the origin of time. This would have to
  be modeled as part of the random data generator, making it
  non-trivial.

#### Idea 3: Everything exists

If everything exists, then the world taken as a whole is trivial and
it's equivalent to not existing at all. A difficulty would be to come
up with a satisfying, rigorous definition of "everything". Everyone
with perfect knowledge would have to agree with that definition since
the theory rests on there being a single, natural everything.

#### Idea 4: The world as a whole contains no information

We could have a new "theory of information" where information held by
a model collapses as the knowledge about this system approaches
completeness.

We could model a system using a collection of variables representing
unknowns and constraints between these variables. The constraints form the
structure of the model. The size of a maximally-compressed structure
of the model gives us its information content.
The complexity of a correct but partial model relates to the
number of possible instantiations of variables in the model.
If two variables are constrained to always have the same value,
they're considered redundant and collapsed into one. This leads to the
elimination of all the redundant variables and of all the variables
constrained to take a single value.
A complete world model would have only one possible instantiation of
variables, making it as simple as the empty model containing no
variable and no structure.

#### Idea 5: We can't compute why the world exists

Maybe we need a hypercomputer and a hypermind to make sense of
why anything exists. A hypercomputer is a hypothetical computer that can
carry out an infinite, countable number of operations within a
finite number of steps. A hypermind would be a mind that could emulate
a hypercomputer if it feels like it.

Someone says something on social media. I want to reply. Should I
really reply?

### <a name="respect-is-earned"></a>Respect is earned


Tolerance can be imposed but respect is earned. Like love, it's not
something that can't be enforced with rules.

* Being respected is generally desirable.
* Being respected by everyone isn't necessary.
* You may fire someone for not respecting another employee but that
  won't make them respectful.
* You may avoid being fired due to leaders or laws that require
  tolerance but that won't earn you respect.
* Your enemies can respect you and still butcher you.
* Tolerance can be a default behavior toward strangers - and I would
  recommend it - but a relationship doesn't start with mutual
  respect. It starts with mere tolerance.
* Disrespect is simply the absence of respect. It doesn't imply hatred.

**tolerance**: intentional avoidance of destructive action<br>
**respect**: feeling of appreciation toward someone's behavior as in
  "I like what they do"<br>
**disrespect**: absence of respect<br>
**love**: feeling of appreciation toward a whole person rather than
  specific behavior<br>
**hatred**: feeling that someone should not be around (?)

### <a name="lasting-interest"></a>Lasting interest


A good painting for home is one that looks a little bit different each
time you look at it. Public space art displays - even museums - don't
have this requirement. It's often enough for them to be cool the first
time you see them and boring thereafter.

Repeated exposures to a movie or to a significant have the same
issue.

### <a name="the-value-of-art"></a>The value of art


An example of [cheap but expert-level](expert-vs-professional) tools
are those involved with minimalistic crafts. For
those, the simplicity of the production process is an essential
feature of the product. In this class of products, the use of advanced
machines in the production process devalues the product. A product
is not just the final, functional piece but also its production
process and even the history of the production process. By buying a
product that's hand-made and fits in a particular culture and
tradition, one acquires a piece of cultural significance. That is, we
can tell stories about its origins. The more unique yet interesting
its story is, the higher a luxury or non-functional object can sell:

* mass production: not unique, low market value
* crafts: objects with interesting stories produced in low numbers
* art: objects with interesting and unique stories

Great art is the product of a unique and remarkable timeline, making it hard
to truly duplicate. It's relatively easy to duplicate the Mona Lisa, but the
resulting copies are worthless in comparison because they don't add
much to the history of art. However, discovering a new painting by
Leonardo da Vinci, even a mediocre one, would be a major event and
the painting would immediately have a great value.

### <a name="expert-vs-professional"></a>Expert vs. professional


When buying supplies for a new craft, you'll find products under four
broad kinds of labels:

* beginner
* expert
* cheap
* professional

One might think that "expert" and "professional" are the same but they
can actually be opposites. An expert is someone with advanced skills
who's able to take advantage of tools that are too tricky for a
beginner. On the other hand, a professional is someone who makes money
from their craft and can afford supplies that makes their work
easier. Therefore, a beginner with money might prefer
professional-grade tools as long as they're not only suitable for
experts.

Naturally, using two different labels to advertise products
goes in the way of effective marketing, which prefers simpler
formulas. For the customer, the recipe is simple: if you can afford
it, buy professional-grade supplies. Of course you'll have to make
sure that they indeed make your work easier.
Now, there is the other dimension -
beginner vs. expert. While some tools may be cheaper, they may only be
suited to experts. An extreme example and metaphor is bicycle training
wheels. Here, an expert - an ordinary bicycle rider - doesn't need to
buy training wheels. Riding without training wheels is faster and cheaper.
In that case, the expert-level product is no product at all. Not many
actual products fall into the cheap-product-for-experts category,
though, because experts are often also professionals who can afford
and will pay for better tools.

### <a name="theres-no-correct-perception"></a>There's no correct perception


There's no correct perception, only useful perception.

The interpretation of sensory input - perception - is a process that
generates concepts in a given context. Elements of context that
influence perception include:

- genetics of the individual mind
- history, culture, and specific events the mind went through
- current state of mind
- health, alertness, physical trauma
- psychoactive drugs

Perception is imagination primed with sensory input. Too little
imagination and no useful concept or abstraction emerges. Too much
imagination and the concepts are no longer relevant to the surrounding
environment. In both cases, the consequence is the failure to take on
actions that benefit the mind's body.

### <a name="it-doesnt-matter-what-qualifies-as-art"></a>It doesn't matter what qualifies as art


It doesn't matter what qualifies as art. "art" isn't an absolute or
necessary concept, it's a label that may or may not make sense in a
given context. When a label stops making sense, obsessing over it is
madness.

### <a name="why-beliefs-matter"></a>Why do beliefs matter?


In my model of mind, beliefs are explicit (conscious) parts of the
world model that a mind maintains. They can be communicated or revised
as necessary and in that sense, they're no different from notes on
paper. So why do they matter? They're used like notes or any other
symbols that were planted in the environment as reminders of some
concepts. I view this "symbol planting" as a way to (re)populate the
imagination on demand. It could be your own imagination or the
imagination of others. It bypasses original sensing. For example, the
written description of a banana can substitute itself to the sight of
an actual banana. I see beliefs as imagination primers, and
imagination sets the context for (intuitive) decision making. That's
why it's important that beliefs or their communicated form be
sufficiently correct for the application at hand.

### <a name="own-your-sh-t"></a>Own your sh*t


Own your sh\*t. It's called sh\*t for a reason. It's your legacy and
it's not perfect. It never is.

Justification:

Society emerges from the recognition of individuals. An individual is
located in space and time. More than this, it is tied to a sphere of
influence. We assigne causes to events and we stop in the chain when
hitting a decision center - the mind of an individual. For example, a
recognized causality chain would be:

global warming<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
excessive CO$_2$ emissions<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
bad governance of world countries<br>
⇑ [caused by]<br>
leaders of world countries<br>
⇑ elections ???<br>
citizens

It's generally the leaders of the countries that are held responsible, not the
citizens that put them in power.

Individual members of society are considered responsible for their
actions, or they're not members of society. This is how various
societies have emerged throughout history. sometimes, some individuals
are considered less responsible than others but nonetheless, it's hard
to find cases where someone else is held responsible instead. Examples
of classes of people that have been historically considered less
responsible include:

* slaves
* minors
* women
* ethnic groups, casts
* unintelligent people

While there's no scientific reason why the world must be comprised of
one or more societies, it is the framework within which humans
operate. It follows from the emergence of individuals minds although
it's not necessary. Many animals arguably have minds but are not
meaningfully organized as societies. Even a human, when stranded alone
on a desert island, ceases to function within a society. Another
class of scenarios with unclear consequences involve hive minds. A
hive mind a spatially distributed, which may temporarily be split into
individual minds due to communication network failures but eventually
reconnects. It is what humans might turn into if they became
telepathically connected, possibly using brain implants and wireless
communication networks. We don't have historical evidence of actual
hive minds to have a clear sense of how responsibility and justice
would be implemented in such societies, if we may still call them
societies. We could speculate that hive minds tend to not be
competitive in the world and die out precisely due to the lack of blame
assignment to their individual constituents, as well as the lack of
competition between multiple hive minds if they keep merging into
bigger hive minds on first contact. This is to say that a hive mind
may not be evolutionary competitive unless it implements some
mechanism that guarantees its evolution and survival in changing
environment. This is a concern when one considers that the major
contributor to the evolution of intelligence in humans may have been
intraspecific conflict, i.e. war. Modern communication technology may
be bringing humans closer to functioning as a hive mind. However, we
still operate as a society with well-defined individuals, and we have
laws and traditions based on that. Historically, efforts to assign or
deassign responsibility from actual decision centers - the individual
minds - have failed massively. See for example dictatorships or
attempts to create pure collectivist societies where everyone is
equally deserving regardless of they do.

### <a name="causality-doesnt-exist"></a>Causality doesn't exist


Causality doesn't exist in the scientific sense. While it's present in
many useful models, it is always possible to extend the model without
respecting the causality relationships.

Causality is usually of this form:

* Two categories of events are recognized.
* An event is a state of the system at a point in time.
* The events occur within a time (range) from one another with some
  statistical correlation.
* The event occurring first is said to cause the event that occurs
  earlier.
