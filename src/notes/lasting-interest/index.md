% Lasting interest


A good painting for home is one that looks a little bit different each
time you look at it. Public space art displays - even museums - don't
have this requirement. It's often enough for them to be cool the first
time you see them and boring thereafter.

Repeated exposures to a movie or to a significant have the same
issue.
