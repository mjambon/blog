% There's no correct perception


There's no correct perception, only useful perception.

The interpretation or sensory input - perception - is a process that
generates concepts in a givenn context. Elements of context that
influence perception include:

- genetics of the individual mind
- history, culture, and specific events the mind went through
- current state of mind
- health, alertness, physical trauma
- psychoactive drugs

Perception is imagination primed with sensory input. Too little
imagination and no useful concept or abstraction emerges. Too much
imagination and the concepts are no longer relevant to the surrounding
environment. In both cases, the consequence is the failure to take on
actions that benefit the mind's body.
