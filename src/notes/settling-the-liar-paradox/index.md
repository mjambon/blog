% Settling the liar's paradox


The liar's paradox is the problem of interpreting a sentence uttered
by someone who never tells the truth, in which they claim they're
not telling the truth.

The paradox comes from the confusion between truth and
belief. Consider the following:

- Like anyone else, a liar has beliefs and they may or may not be true.
- A liar is someone who produces sentences which are not their beliefs.

Therefore, the truthfulness of a statement is independent from
whether the person making them is lying. The common phrase
"tell the truth" is a misnomer and should be instead
"state your belief".

When someone makes a statement, it is assumed that they
express one of their beliefs. In the case of a liar, this assumption is
incorrect. We could check this if we had a perfect lie detector that
reads their mind.

A given statement is characterized by a pair (believed?,
true?). The first value indicates whether the author believes the
statement:

- believed (B)
- disbelieved (D)
- agnostic (A): neither believed nor disbelieved

The second value indicates whether the statement is true in a **model of
reference** consisting of a deductive system accompanied with the set
of statements that were either proven or disproven:

- true (T): we have a proof for the statement
- false (F): we have a proof of its negation
- other (O): we don't have a proof, for whatever reason

This gives us nine categories of statements. Highlighted statements
are the most commonly encountered:

- **[B, T]** the honest expression of a correct belief;
- **[B, F]** mistake: the honest expression of an incorrect belief;
- **[B, O]** genuine discovery, false discovery, or expression of
  faith: the honest expression of a belief that was neither proven nor
  disproven in the model of reference;
- **[D, F]** ordinary lie: a statement that their author believes to be
  false and is indeed false;
- [D, T] correct lie: statement that their author believes to be false but
  is in fact true.
- [D, O] malicious misguidance: a statement that their authors believes to be
  false but was neither proven nor disproven in the model of
  reference;
- [A, F], [A, T], [A, O]: a type of lie for which the author doesn't
  know the truth but pretends they do and make something up.
  It could be made in an effort to appear confident in front of a
  particular audience.

Since we just settled the liar's paradox, we might as well settle the
meaning of truth.

**truth**: whether a statement was proven within a model of reference taken
to be universal. Science is the activity conducted by a society, such as
humanity, that builds such a world model. This model gets revised
and extended over time by reconciliating it with other models derived from
experimental observations and computations. In practice, there's not a unique
place where our universal model is written unambiguously.
Even if we decided the exact collection of books and articles that compose it,
it would contain inconsistencies due to various types of mistakes,
approximations, and guesses. However, it would also contain a lot
of redundancy, allowing certain statements to be considered more reliable
than others. Those are what we call the truth in ordinary speech.

There is no absolute truth, only models.
