% Respect is earned


Tolerance can be imposed but respect is earned. Like love, it's not
something that can't be enforced with rules.

* Being respected is generally desirable.
* Being respected by everyone isn't necessary.
* You may fire someone for not respecting another employee but that
  won't make them respectful.
* You may avoid being fired due to leaders or laws that require
  tolerance but that won't earn you respect.
* Your enemies can respect you and still butcher you.
* Tolerance can be a default behavior toward strangers - and I would
  recommend it - but a relationship doesn't start with mutual
  respect. It starts with mere tolerance.
* Disrespect is simply the absence of respect. It doesn't imply hatred.

**tolerance**: intentional avoidance of destructive action<br>
**respect**: feeling of appreciation toward someone's behavior as in
  "I like what they do"<br>
**disrespect**: absence of respect<br>
**love**: feeling of appreciation toward a whole person rather than
  specific behavior<br>
**hatred**: feeling that someone should not be around (?)
