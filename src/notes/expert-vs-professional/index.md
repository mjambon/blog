% Expert vs. professional


When buying supplies for a new craft, you'll find products under four
broad kinds of labels:

* beginner
* expert
* cheap
* professional

One might think that "expert" and "professional" are the same but they
can actually be opposites. An expert is someone with advanced skills
who's able to take advantage of tools that are too tricky for a
beginner. On the other hand, a professional is someone who makes money
from their craft and can afford supplies that makes their work
easier. Therefore, a beginner with money might prefer
professional-grade tools as long as they're not only suitable for
experts.

Naturally, using two different labels to advertise products
goes in the way of effective marketing, which prefers simpler
formulas. For the customer, the recipe is simple: if you can afford
it, buy professional-grade supplies. Of course you'll have to make
sure that they indeed make your work easier.
Now, there is the other dimension -
beginner vs. expert. While some tools may be cheaper, they may only be
suited to experts. An extreme example and metaphor is bicycle training
wheels. Here, an expert - an ordinary bicycle rider - doesn't need to
buy training wheels. Riding without training wheels is faster and cheaper.
In that case, the expert-level product is no product at all. Not many
actual products fall into the cheap-product-for-experts category,
though, because experts are often also professionals who can afford
and will pay for better tools.
