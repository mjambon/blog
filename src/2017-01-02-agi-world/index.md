A world of intelligent machines
===============================

This is how I see a future with machines capable of general
intelligence, as of January 2017.

Freedom and responsibility
--------------------------

With intelligence comes control and freedom. Intelligent beings will
find ways to achieve their purposes. There is no reason why they would
let less intelligent beings dictate what they should do with their
lives. Treating them as tools will be considered a form of slavery.

Limited resources
-----------------

Intelligent beings, human or machines, will continue to compete for
the control of resources, including:

* energy
* materials
* information
* territories
* family
* allies

Identity cloning
----------------

Perfect replication of an existing individual will be
possible. Instead of giving birth to children who have to relearn
everything, duplicating an intelligent system will be straightforward
using 20th century computer technology. This will create a number
of new situations:

* indefinite life: there is no longer a need for the birth of naive
  individuals. New individuals are entirely cloned from adults and fully
  productive. Their birthday is the birthday of their common ancestor.
* deaths: the physical support for individuals can be damaged, so the
  possibility of death remains and continues to cause various sorts
  of losses.
* shared liability: cloned identities share the liability for all
  their actions that occurred before the duplication. If one person
  committed a crime but was since cloned, there are now two people who
  committed that crime.
