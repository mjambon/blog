Universal career advice
=======================

_I am now 37 years old and it's only been a few years since I feel I
am working the way I like, with people I like, toward goals that are
meaningful to me. I am picky and I want the best for myself.
Without entering into the specifics of my job and
lifestyle, here is some advice I built for myself over the years,
and wish I had when I was 16. I think it applies to most people._

Learn about your needs
----------------------

- Figure out whether you are more of an [introvert or an
  extrovert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion).
  Learn how to take advantage of it. Learn to identify this
  trait in other people and use it for better communication.
- Who needs to attend school? You do, and it has nothing to do with
  how intelligent you think you are. Choose a school that will teach
  you what you need the most. Favor better teaching over prestige. Use
  the opportunity to live in another place and in another culture,
  possibly another country. Take advantage of free, high-quality
  online classes. Favor classes that teach you core knowledge that you
  won't be able to learn properly on the job later.
- Who needs a job? You probably do, but don't do it for your
  parents. Produce the best contribution to society and the job
  problem will solve itself naturally with a gentle push.
- Money vastly contributes to freedom, but is not all. Do not be
  extreme about money in one direction or another.
- Is this job ideal for you? Rate each of the following on a scale
  from 0 to 10 and add them up:
    * Fun (10 points): how enjoyable is it going to be to work like this for
      the next 10 years?
    * Income (10 points): how well does it pay?
    * Skills (10 points): how good at this job am I going to be, in
      comparison to my peers and to jobseekers?


Optimize your attitude
----------------------

- Learn how to communicate well. It matters for all professions. It's
  about being well understood by your colleagues, partners, and
  customers. Keep it simple, overcommunicate rather than
  undercommunicate.
- Be honest and direct. That will save time.
- Everyone has some intelligence. Successful people are not the most
  intelligent but those who use their intelligence for the most
  critical decisions. This will take some boldness.
- Use your intuition to form ideas, but validate them with facts
  before making a decision. Eliminate wishful thinking, it doesn't
  work.
- Acknowledge your emotions and divert them into constructive
  forces. When angry, excuse yourself and postpone the
  conversation until you're calm and rational again. When happy, work
  harder.
- Always listen, never obey. You can learn things from most people
  around you, but it can be very indirect, they can be plain wrong, or
  worse, all the people you talk to may be wrong about the same
  thing. You often can learn more from your enemy or from strangers
  than from your close friends or relatives; use that to your
  advantage.


Move into the best environment
------------------------------

- Surround yourself with inspiring people.
- Surround yourself with people of diverse backgrounds you can learn from.
- Surround yourself with people who care about you.
- Do not expect luck. Learn to detect opportunities and seize them.


Take care of yourself
---------------------

- Pace yourself. Adopt a physical routine once a week every week for
  the rest of your life. Let others know that it is part of your
  lifestyle.
- Don't stress over things you don't even need. Learn to do with less,
  it's simpler and faster.
- Keep learning, it'll keep you young.
