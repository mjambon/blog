I've always wanted to communicate my general thoughts about the world but
didn't want to write a book for a few reasons. First, I have limited
talent for writing and I'm not particularly interested in the art of
storytelling.
Second, my thoughts change and by the time I would be done writing a
chapter, I would have changed my mind about it and would have to
rewrite the whole chapter, if not the rest of the book. Third,
concepts don't follow a particular order like a good
story. Some terms are defined independently from each other and the
reader should not have to read one
before the other, nor should they have to work hard to guess which
chapters can be safely skipped.
This is why instead of a book made of chapters and paragraphs,
I've decided to use a dictionary format, with the
additional constraint that there be no cyclic definitions.
</p>
<p>
The avoidance of mutually-dependent definitions results in an acyclic
<a href="#dag">dependency graph</a> shown at
the bottom of this page.
It gives the reader a quick view of which concepts are more foundational
than others.
</p>
<p>
This dictionary is an attempt to define or clarify various terms I
consider important and unambiguous in my view of the world. Emphasis
is placed on simplicity, consistency, and approachability.
If I deem the approach successful, the document will
