Definitions of life
===================

Here are 3 practical definitions of _life_, which are useful in their
respective contexts and are also fairly independent from each other.

Medical definition of life: self-sustenance
---

A physical entity, called an _organism_, is alive as long as it is
able to take care of itself to some large extent. It should be able to
acquire and process resources needed to maintain its general
state. Life is defined per individual and ends with the _death_ of that
individual. Whenever death is being discussed, this is the definition
of life that's being used.

Examples:

* _Fortunately no human lives were lost during this accident._
* _The android's life ended as he attempted to swim across the English
  Channel._
* Humans rarely live longer than 100 years.

Counter-examples:

* Rocks are not alive as they don't regenerate in any way after being
  altered by external conditions.

Biological definition of life: self-replication
---

In science, life is defined for a set of organisms with a common
ancestor. It is the ability for one or a few of such organisms to produce
similar organisms with the same ability to reproduce.

Examples:

* All life observed today on Earth derives from a common ancestor.
* Some wonder whether life existed on an asteroid before being brought
  onto Earth.
* Life on Earth is at least 3.5 billion years old.

Chemical reactions, nuclear reactions, and dominoes collapsing are
typically not normally considered life, although they somewhat fit the
definition above. Their reproduction can be seen as a spontaneous
reaction of the form:

Source of Matter and Energy + Parental Energy &rarr; Unusable Matter + more
Parental Energy

Technological definition of life: self-adaptation
---

In this definition, physical entities that can improve the
efficiency with which they deal with their environment are said to be
life-forms. This includes all organisms and machines capable of
learning. This excludes evolution in the traditional biological sense
where random mutations generated in a parent organism take effect only
in the children, where children constitute distinct organisms. If the
mutated children were considered part of the same organism as the
parents, which we'd call a colony, then it would be fair to treat
this trial-and-error internal evolution as a mechanism for self
adaptation.

Examples:

* Dogs learn to identify and please their master.
* [Catabolic repression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catabolite_repression)
  in _E. coli_ is the mechanism by which the bacterium switches on the
  production of enzymes depending on which source of food is present
  in its environment.
* Online stores remember what items I viewed or purchased in the past and
  suggest similar items.

Counter-examples:

* A single chemical reaction, as it requires by definition reactants of a
  specific nature in specific proportions.
