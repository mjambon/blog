This is a glossary of terms that I use in the context of my own
work on artificial cognition.

<p>
Definitions are acyclic, i.e. a definition may contain only links
to previously defined terms. <a href="#dag">This forms a DAG</a>
(directed acyclic graph) of terms, with the most foundational terms at the
bottom.
