- term: system
  def: >
    An instance of the machine we’re building and studying.
  syn:
    - systems

- term: environment
  def: >
    Anything that is not part of the [system], with which the [system]
    exchanges information via input and output ports.
    Parts of the [environment] that are inaccessible to
    other [systems] constitute the [system]’s private
    [environment].
  syn:
    - environments

- term: world
  def: >
    The union of a [system] and its [environment].
  syn:
    - worlds

- term: cloning
  def: >
    Copying a full [system]. Unlike biological cloning, this
    includes copying all the acquired cognitive skills and
    therefore the identity of the [system].

- term: node
  def: >
    Any kind of persistent element in the [system], that transmits
    information. More generally, it has the usual meaning of vertex in graph
    theory.
  syn:
    - nodes

- term: activation
  def: >
    Setting a single [node] to its [active] state. A [node]
    remains [active] only for one cycle, after which it is
    systematically deactivated i.e. switched to its
    default state. In order to be considered continuously
    [active], a [node] needs to be activated at each
    cycle. An [active] [node] transmits a unary
    signal to other [nodes] or components, while an [inactive]
    [node] doesn’t.
  syn:
    - activate
    - activates
    - activating
    - activated
    - active
    - inactive

- term: concept
  def: >
    A [node] that represents a set of states of the
    [world]. An [active] instance of such [node].
  syn:
    - concepts

- term: action
  def: >
    (1) The [activation] of an output port, which may modify
    the environment. An [action] is said internal if other [systems]
    cannot sense these changes in the environment. (2) An output port.
  syn:
    - actions

- term: abstract
  def: >
    Given two [concepts] A and B, A is said more [abstract]
    than B if the [activation] of B triggers the [activation] of A,
    but the [activation] of A can take place without B.

- term: fitness
  def: >
    The single numeric variable that changes over time and
    that the [system] tries to maximize.
    At least some of the rules that the [system] uses
    to compute the fitness are built in. For example, an
    external operator would press a green button to add 1 to
    the fitness at the current cycle or a red button to
    add -1. The intended effect is to reward or punish the
    [system] and encourage certain behaviors.

- term: anticipation
  def: >
    A mechanism by which the [system] rewards itself based
    on the expected reward for [actions] that it just
    decided to take. A reward refers to the value of the
    [fitness] considered to be resulting from a set of [actions].

- term: concrete
  def: >
    The opposite of [abstract].

- term: context
  def: >
    (1) A [concept]. (2) The set of all the states of the [world]
    which are sufficient to activate a [node].
  syn:
    - contexts

- term: emotion
  def: >
    (1) A built-in parameter of the [system] which can take a
    range of values and affects the behavior of the whole
    [system] in a predetermined manner. Its value changes over
    time and can be sensed by the [system] itself. (2) A
    specific value of such parameter.
  syn:
    - emotions

- term: input
  def: >
    Shorthand term for "sensing input", which designates the
    fixed-length bit vector refreshed at regular intervals
    that’s available to the [system] for sensing the environment.
    This excludes the external reward passed to the
    [system] via a special-purpose port and used in the
    computation of the [fitness].

- term: sensing
  def: >
    The [activation] of [input] ports.

- term: mind
  def: >
    A [system] that works as expected.
  syn:
    - minds

- term: model
  def: >
    A representation of the [world].
  syn:
    - models

- term: optimization
  def: >
    Numeric optimization, usually referring to the
    maximization of the [fitness] variable by the [system].

- term: output
  def: >
    Fixed-length bit vector updated by the [system]
    periodically. A cell in the output vector is called an
    [action]. The [activation] of an output cell is
    called an [action] as well. Such [activation] typically
    results in a modification of the [environment].

- term: pattern
  def: >
    A set of [input] values identifiable by the [system].
  syn:
    - patterns

- term: perception
  def: >
    The [activation] of a [concept] that’s considered similar
    to a [concept] of reference in another [system] or more
    generally in an external model of the [world].

- term: imagination
  def: >
    The ability to [activate] a [concept] in either of two contexts,
    one being more [abstract] than the other.

- term: intuition
  def: >
    The ability for a [system] to make decisions without
    resorting to an emulation of Boolean
    logic. For design and implementation purposes, [imagination],
    [intuition], and [perception] are considered equivalent.

- term: intelligence
  def: >
    The ability for a [system] to adapt increasingly
    faster to new [environments].
