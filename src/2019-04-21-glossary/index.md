**abstract**: Given two known concepts A and B, A is said more abstract
            than B if the activation of B triggers the activation of A,
            but the activation of A can take place without B.

**action**: (1) The activation of an output port, which may modify
        the environment. An action is said internal if other systems
        cannot sense these changes in the environment. (2) An output port.

**activation**: Setting a single node to its active state, its other state
              being inactive. A node remains active only for one
              cycle, after which it is systematically deactivated. In
              order to be considered continuously active, a node needs
              to be activated at each successive cycle.

**anticipation**: A mechanism by which the system rewards itself based
                on the expected reward for actions that it just
                decided to take. A reward refers to the value of the
                fitness considered to be resulting from a set of actions.

**cloning**: Copying a full system. Unlike biological cloning, this
           includes copying all the acquired cognitive skills and
           therefore the identity of the system.

**concept**: (1) A node that represents a set of states of the
             world. (2) An active instance of such node.

**concrete**: The opposite of abstract.

**context**: (1) A concept. (2) The set of all the states of the world
             which are sufficient to activate a node.

**emotion**: (1) A range of values of a built-in parameter
             of the system which affects the behavior of the whole
             system in a predetermined manner, is triggered by some
             states of the system, and can be sensed by the system
             itself. (2) A value in that range.
