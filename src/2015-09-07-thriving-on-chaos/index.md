Thriving on chaos
=================

> Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army?
I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to
lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away
inside me.

&mdash; _the ruthless leader of the bad guys in The Postman (1997 movie)_

What's hard about startups
--------------------------

- vague need but not obvious right solution for it
  "if would be nice if ... but how?"

- tight budget because promises don't sell well

- need to fill specialty positions initially without specialists

- employees have no guarantee to keep the job for as long as they do
  their job well

- nobody has done this before; or they did it wrong and failed;
  critics have no idea what they're talking about;
  no validated process for doing what you do, so nobody
  can tell you if you're doing a good job until it's too late

Overcoming these difficulties
-----------------------------

- be explicit about goals
- create measurable short-term goals
- eliminate fears and taboos by learning (either from external sources
  or by experimentation)
- support each other
- make sure your hires know what they're in for
- don't fall in love with stuff; stuff you create is a necessary
  burden; ideally we would use components off-the-shelf and eventually we
  will.
- eliminate distractions and false hopes

Seizing opportunities
---------------------

- realize that most people are not very good at detecting
  opportunities and taking them
- don't be emotionally affected by good luck or bad luck
- stay simple and curious
- engineer's fallacy: this project is 90% complete therefore we
  shouldn't drop it. If a project is deemed useless before its
  completion, completing it is only a matter a pride for its
  makers. This is natural but a waste of time and money.
  Logical fallacy:
  "This completed project is worth the value it would have had when it
  started"
