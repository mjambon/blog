% Dictionary
This is an attempt to construct a dictionary of various terms which I
consider important and unambiguous in my view of the world. Emphasis is
placed on simplicity, consistency, and approachability. This document is
meant to evolve on a continuous basis rather than being the subject of
official releases.

[]{#vanity-776f726c64}**world**: [A subject of study plus everything
that interacts with it directly or indirectly. It is normally referred
to as \"the\" world because it is everything that exists. There is no
mathematical definition for it. Referring to multiple worlds or to \"a\"
world is an abuse of language indicating a model of the world that is
made up of multiple independent models.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-6d6f64656c}**model**: [An unambiguous representation of the
[world](#vanity-776f726c64){.vanity-term-link}. As such, a model can in
principle be translated into another language and recovered back without
loss. A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be
expressed.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-74696d65}**time**: [An ordering over the states of a
[model](#vanity-6d6f64656c){.vanity-term-link}. Time is the breakdown of
a model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints over
those states. A more specific definition of time is part of each model,
if the model relies on such notion of time or successive states. Unless
otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer programs uses a
discrete, nonnegative index t to reference the successive steps of a
computation. An ideal scenario is a computation of discrete states
starting from an initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The
transition function computes the next state from the previous one. Such
computations are called simulations. More generally however, when there
is no need for computing successive states, time is usually modeled as
the real line.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-696e646976696475616c}**individual**: [In a
[model](#vanity-6d6f64656c){.vanity-term-link} of the
[world](#vanity-776f726c64){.vanity-term-link}, an individual is a
mutable entity which interacts with the rest of world, including other
individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous period of
[time](#vanity-74696d65){.vanity-term-link}, usually in a binary
fashion: at a given time, the individual either exists or doesn\'t
exist.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-6172746966696369616c}**artificial**: [The property of being
created by
[individuals](#vanity-696e646976696475616c){.vanity-term-link}, as
opposed to being imposed by the
[model](#vanity-6d6f64656c){.vanity-term-link} of the
[world](#vanity-776f726c64){.vanity-term-link} in which the individuals
exist.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-6964656e74697479}**identity**: [The collection of properties
associated with an
[individual](#vanity-696e646976696475616c){.vanity-term-link}.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-736574}**set**: [A set as defined in mathematics by the
axioms of set theory.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-72756c65}**rule**: [An
[artificial](#vanity-6172746966696369616c){.vanity-term-link}
constraint. Unlike a physical constraint which can apply to various
portions of a [model](#vanity-6d6f64656c){.vanity-term-link}, an
artificial constraint applies to
[individual](#vanity-696e646976696475616c){.vanity-term-link} members of
a society, and said members can decide whether to follow
it.]{.vanity-contents}

[]{#vanity-736f6369657479}**society**: [A
[set](#vanity-736574){.vanity-term-link} of
[individuals](#vanity-696e646976696475616c){.vanity-term-link} known as
society members within a [model](#vanity-6d6f64656c){.vanity-term-link}
of the [world](#vanity-776f726c64){.vanity-term-link}, and associated
with [rules](#vanity-72756c65){.vanity-term-link}.]{.vanity-contents}
