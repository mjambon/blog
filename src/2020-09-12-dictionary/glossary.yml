# Editing guidelines:
#
# - Keep it easy to maintain.
# - Only add a term if it has a crystal-clear definition.
# - When two terms are synonymous, redirect one to the other.
# - Warn against terms with context-sensitive definitions and
#   discourage their use when context is unclear.
# - Terms with standard definitions can have an entry in this
#   dictionary, but for the sake of simplicity they should say so and not
#   attempt to redefine the term precisely.
# - Context about how and when a term is used is welcome. This
#   generally involves concepts for which a definition will be given
#   only later.

- term: world
  def: >-
    A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it
    directly or indirectly. It is normally referred to as "the"
    world because it is everything that exists. There is no mathematical
    definition for it.
    Referring to multiple worlds or to "a" world is an abuse of language
    indicating a model of the world that is made up of multiple independent
    models.

- term: model
  def: >-
    An unambiguous representation of the [world]. As such, a model can
    in principle be translated into another language and recovered
    back without loss.
    A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be
    expressed.

- term: time
  def: >-
    An ordering over the states of a [model]. Time is the breakdown of a
    model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints
    over those states.
    A more specific definition of time is part of each model, if the
    model relies on such notion of time or successive states.
    Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer
    programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t
    to reference the successive steps of a computation. An ideal
    scenario is a computation of discrete states starting from an
    initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The transition
    function computes the next state from the previous one. Such
    computations are called simulations.
    More generally however, when there is no need for computing successive
    states, time is usually modeled as the real line.

- term: individual
  def: >-
    In a [model] of the [world], an individual is a mutable
    entity which interacts with the rest of world, including other
    individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous period of
    [time], usually in a binary fashion: at a given time, the individual
    either exists or doesn't exist.
  syn:
    - individuals

- term: artificial
  def: >-
    The property of being created by [individuals], as
    opposed to being imposed by the [model] of the [world] in which the
    individuals exist.

- term: identity
  def: >-
    The collection of properties associated with an [individual].
  syn:
    - identities

- term: set
  def: >-
    A set as defined in mathematics by the axioms of set theory.
  syn:
    - sets

- term: rule
  def: >-
    An [artificial] constraint. Unlike a physical constraint which can
    apply to various portions of a [model], an artificial constraint
    applies to [individual] members of a society, and said members can
    decide whether to follow it.
  syn:
    - rules

- term: society
  def: >-
    A [set] of [individuals] known as society members within
    a [model] of the [world], and associated with [rules].
  syn:
    - societies
