# Editing guidelines:
#
# - Keep it easy to maintain.
# - Only add a term if it has a crystal-clear definition.
# - When two terms are synonymous, redirect one to the other.
# - Warn against terms with context-sensitive definitions and
#   discourage their use when context is unclear.
# - Terms with standard definitions can have an entry in this
#   dictionary, but for the sake of simplicity they should say so and not
#   attempt to redefine the term precisely.
# - Context about how and when a term is used is welcome. This
#   generally involves concepts for which a definition will be given
#   only later.
# - State prerequisites.
# - Give examples.

- term: world
  def: >-
    A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it
    directly or indirectly. It is normally referred to as "the"
    world because it is everything that exists from the subject's
    perspective. An interaction can be modeled as a flow of
    information, for some definition of information to be specified.
    A world is isolated from everything else, and therefore anything
    modeled within the world cannot learn anything about the existence
    or the nature of other worlds.

- term: model
  def: >-
    An unambiguous representation of the [world]. As such, a model can
    in principle, given sufficient technology, be translated into
    another language and recovered back without loss.
    A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be
    expressed. An example of a simple model is the representation of the
    sun and the earth as points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space,
    with the sun being immobile and the earth rotating in a circular
    orbit over a one-year period. Elementary mathematical
    knowledge is sufficient to read and copy this model without
    mistakes. Our definition of a model includes any arrangement of
    information that is believed to form a world model but
    may not be accessed or copied in its entirety. For example, a
    human body, mostly in its brain, holds world model, some
    of which was learned by interacting with it since birth. While we
    may not have the technology to copy correctly and completely the
    relevant information from a human brain, we assume it's all
    in there. Such world model that's a necessary part of any human
    mind shall not be confused with whatever explicit models a thinker
    or scientist can construct and publish.

- term: time
  def: >-
    An ordering over the states of a [model]. Time is the breakdown of a
    model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints
    over those states.
    A more specific definition of time is part of each model, if the
    model relies on such notion of time or successive states.
    Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer
    programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t
    to reference the successive steps of a computation. An ideal
    scenario is a computation of discrete states starting from an
    initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The transition
    function computes the next state from the previous one. Such
    computations are called simulations.
    More generally however, when there is no need for computing successive
    states, time is usually modeled as the real line.

- term: system
  def: >-
    A system refers to a partial [model]. It can be obtained by
    taking some elements of a [world] model and ignoring all
    interactions with the rest of the world, or by modeling the rest of
    the world in a simpler manner than in the original model. For
    example, modeling a car could consist in retaining a model of the
    car components as well as a model of a road and how the car
    interacts with the road, discarding all other elements of the
    world such as buildings and trees. In this example, the car is the
    system and the road is the rest of the world.

- term: environment
  def: >-
    In a [model] comprising [systems], the environment refers to
    everything in the model that's not part of the system under
    consideration.
  syn:
    - environments
  img: environment.jpg

- term: sensing
  def: >-
    The acquisition of raw data by a [system] from the [environment].
    This is usually done by special-purpose parts of the system, which
    are called sensors.

- term: parameter
  def: >-
    A parameter of a [model] is any property of this model that is left
    unspecified, defining a function in the usual mathematical sense.
    In general, a model can have any number of parameters.
  syn:
    - parameters

- term: state
  def: >-
    A particular instantiation of the [parameters] of a [model].
  syn:
    - states

- term: mutable
  def: >-
    An entity is said mutable when it consists of [time]-indexed
    sequence of [states]. Such sequence of states is meant to represent
    successive transformation of an initial object within a model.

- term: individual
  def: >-
    In a [model] of the [world], an individual is a [mutable]
    [system] which interacts with the rest of world, including other
    individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous period of
    [time], usually in a binary fashion: at a given time, the individual
    either exists or doesn't exist.
  syn:
    - individuals
  img: individual.jpg

- term: artificial
  def: >-
    The property of being created by [individuals], as
    opposed to being imposed by the [model] of the [world] in which the
    individuals exist.

- term: identity
  def: >-
    The collection of properties associated with an [individual].
  syn:
    - identities

- term: set
  def: >-
    A set as defined in mathematics by the axioms of set theory.
  syn:
    - sets

- term: rule
  def: >-
    An [artificial] constraint. Unlike a physical constraint which can
    apply to various portions of a [model], an artificial constraint
    applies to [individual] members of a society, and said members can
    decide whether to follow it.
  syn:
    - rules

- term: society
  def: >-
    A [set] of [individuals] known as society members within
    a [model] of the [world], and associated with [rules].

  def: >-
    A model of the world without a [society].

- term: tool
  def: >-
    A tool, in the very general sense that interests us, is an extension
    of what's normally considered the body of an individual and
    facilitates their interaction with the [environment]. This
    definition includes all machines, methods, and processes stored
    outside of the normal body of an individual. In the usual human world,
    this includes not just physical devices such as a hammer or a
    computer, but also all data stored outside the body such as books
    and other recordings. Therefore, other individuals can also be
    considered as tools according this definition.

  def: >-
    The study of the structure of unambiguous statements. Mathematics
    are useful for dealing with [models] in [science], [engineering], and
    other fields of study.
  syn:

- term: computer
  def: >-
    A finite [system] that reads discrete instructions and carries them out
    predictably. A computer can be [represented] as a sequence of [states]
    comprising a [mutable], discrete storage space. Turing machines
    are idealized representations of computers with unbounded storage
    or memory; they are used in theoretical studies for proving some
    properties of computers. This definition excludes
    hypercomputers, which would allow solving problems that Turing
    machines cannot, such as the halting problem.
  syn:
    - computers

- term: logic
  def: >-
    The [mathematical] subfield of logic. It is focused on the
    general properties of formal systems and characterizing what can
    and cannot be done with mathematics and [computers].

  def: >-
    The [successive] [states] of a [computer].
  syn:

- term: program
  def: >-
    A computer program in the usual sense. A program consists of a
    finite collection of instructions that can be executed by a
    computer or by a Turing machine. A program may or may not take
    external input. In theoretical studies, the input is often
    baked into the program or into the initial state of the computer's
    memory. A program may or not terminate. Determining whether a
    program terminates is not always possible, which is known as the
    halting problem. A program can be viewed as a mathematical proof
    and vice-versa, which is known as the Curry-Howard correspondence,
    and offers a link between [logic] and [computation].
  syn:

- term: algorithm
  def: >-
    An algorithm is a [program] that terminates.
  syn:
    - algorithms

- term: action
  def: >-
    A change in two [successive] [states] of a [system] that determines
    a change elsewhere in the [world] [model], possibly in the system
    itself.
  syn:
    - actions

- term: decision
  def: >-
    An [action] of a [system] onto itself, in particular when
    examining a small selection of possible actions that are mutually
    exclusive.
  img: actions.jpg

- term: mind
  def: >-
    The components of a [system] that make it more durable
    independently from its other properties.
    This tentative definition is meant to incorporate the dualist notion
    that the mind is separate from the rest of the body and somewhat
    optional, while emphasizing that it's only a simplified model
    useful for studying [decision] [processes].

- term: cognition
  def: >-
    The properties of a [mind].

- term: concept
  def: >-
    A binary state within a [mind]. A concept is generally
    considered to be turned on or off by the activity of the mind,
    including other concepts.
  syn:
    - concepts

- term: abstract
  def: >-
    A [concept] is said more abstract than another when its full
    definition from elementary concepts is more complex.

- term: concrete
  def: >-
    The opposite of [abstract]. A [concept] is more concrete than
    another when it is less abstract. In a [mind], the most concrete
    concepts are the [states] of [sensors].

- term: intuition
  def: >-
    The activation of [abstract] [concepts] or ideas within a [mind].

- term: perception
  def: >-
    A form of [intuition] involving [concepts] that form a [model] of
    the [world] as it is being [sensed].

- term: optimization
  def: >-
    An activity consisting in modifying a [system] so as to increase
    its fitness, which is a number, specifically an element taken from
    an ordered set. The goal function, objective function or fitness
    function is the function that maps a [state] of a system to the
    number referred to as fitness.

  def: >-
    A conventional representation of a [concept]. It is a component
    of the [world] to which some members of a [society] will [react] in
    a similar manner and that does not provide [benefits] other than
    eliciting similar reactions in others.
  syn:
    - symbols

- term: imagination
  def: >-
    A form of [intuition], generally involving [concepts] for which
    [symbols] already exist.
