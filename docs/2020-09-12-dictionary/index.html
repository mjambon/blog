<p>I've always wanted to communicate my general thoughts about the world but didn't want to write a book for a few reasons. First, I have limited talent for writing and I'm not particularly interested in the art of storytelling. Second, my thoughts change and by the time I would be done writing a chapter, I would have changed my mind about it and would have to rewrite the whole chapter, if not the rest of the book. Third, concepts don't follow a particular order like a good story. Some terms are defined independently from each other and the reader should not have to read one before the other, nor should they have to work hard to guess which chapters can be safely skipped. This is why instead of a book made of chapters and paragraphs, I've decided to use a dictionary format, with the additional constraint that there be no cyclic definitions.</p>
<p>The avoidance of mutually-dependent definitions results in an acyclic <a href="#dag">dependency graph</a> shown at the bottom of this page. It gives the reader a quick view of which concepts are more foundational than others.</p>
<p>This dictionary is an attempt to define or clarify various terms I consider important and unambiguous in my view of the world. Emphasis is placed on simplicity, consistency, and approachability. If I deem the approach successful, the document will <a href="https://github.com/mjambon/blog/commits/master/src/2020-09-12-dictionary/glossary.yml">grow and evolve over time</a>.</p>

<p><span id="vanity-776f726c64"></span><strong>world</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it directly or indirectly. It is normally referred to as "the" world because it is everything that exists from the subject's perspective. An interaction can be modeled as a flow of information, for some definition of information to be specified. A world is isolated from everything else, and therefore anything modeled within the world cannot learn anything about the existence or the nature of other worlds.</span></p>

As such, a model can in principle, given sufficient technology, be translated into another language and recovered back without loss. A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be expressed. An example of a simple model is the representation of the sun and the earth as points in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space, with the sun being immobile and the earth rotating in a circular orbit over a one-year period. Elementary mathematical knowledge is sufficient to read and copy this model without mistakes. Our definition of a model includes any arrangement of information that is believed to form a world model but may not be accessed or copied in its entirety. For example, a human body, mostly in its brain, holds world model, some of which was learned by interacting with it since birth. While we may not have the technology to copy correctly and completely the relevant information from a human brain, we assume it's all in there. Such world model that's a necessary part of any human mind shall not be confused with whatever explicit models a thinker or scientist can construct and publish.</span></p>

Time is the breakdown of a model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints over those states. A more specific definition of time is part of each model, if the model relies on such notion of time or successive states. Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t to reference the successive steps of a computation. An ideal scenario is a computation of discrete states starting from an initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The transition function computes the next state from the previous one. Such computations are called simulations. More generally however, when there is no need for computing successive states, time is usually modeled as the real line.</span></p>

It can be obtained by taking some elements of a <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a> model and ignoring all interactions with the rest of the world, or by modeling the rest of the world in a simpler manner than in the original model. For example, modeling a car could consist in retaining a model of the car components as well as a model of a road and how the car interacts with the road, discarding all other elements of the world such as buildings and trees. In this example, the car is the system and the road is the rest of the world.</span></p>

This tentative definition is meant to incorporate the dualist notion that the mind is separate from the rest of the body and somewhat optional, while emphasizing that it's only a simplified model useful for studying <a href="#vanity-6465636973696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">decision</a> <a href="#vanity-636f6d7075746174696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">processes</a>.

<p><span id="vanity-73796d626f6c"></span><strong>symbol</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A conventional representation of a <a href="#vanity-636f6e63657074" class="vanity-term-link">concept</a>. It is a component of the <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a> to which some members of a <a href="#vanity-736f6369657479" class="vanity-term-link">society</a> will <a href="#vanity-7265616374696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">react</a> in a similar manner and that does not provide <a href="#vanity-6f7074696d697a6174696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">benefits</a> other than eliciting similar reactions in others. A special case of a symbol is one that's used only by a single <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individual</a>. It suffices that the concept be identified as such by the individual to be considered a symbol. For example, "that feeling when I do X" shall be considered an internal symbol because it's a concept whose presence is clearly identified by the subject. The subject might then try to reproduce it with the aim of eliciting a particular <a href="#vanity-7265616374696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">reaction</a> in their own <a href="#vanity-6d696e64" class="vanity-term-link">mind</a>.</span></p>

<p><span id="vanity-73656e74656e6365"></span><strong>sentence</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A sentence is a compound <a href="#vanity-73796d626f6c" class="vanity-term-link">symbol</a> i.e. a symbol formed by combining multiple symbols into one.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-6c616e6775616765"></span><strong>language</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A collection of <a href="#vanity-73796d626f6c" class="vanity-term-link">symbols</a> produced by combining other symbols. A combination of symbols that itself forms a symbol is referred to as a <a href="#vanity-73656e74656e6365" class="vanity-term-link">compound symbol</a> or a <a href="#vanity-73656e74656e6365" class="vanity-term-link">sentence</a>. One shall distinguish formal languages from informal languages.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-696e666f726d616c206c616e6775616765"></span><strong>informal language</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">An informal language is a <a href="#vanity-6c616e6775616765" class="vanity-term-link">language</a> made of ambiguous <a href="#vanity-73796d626f6c" class="vanity-term-link">symbols</a>. A simple symbol or a <a href="#vanity-73656e74656e6365" class="vanity-term-link">compound symbol</a> is ambiguous if it elicits different <a href="#vanity-7265616374696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">reactions</a> in different people. For example, a simple English sentence like "the sky is blue" is ambiguous at least because different people have different notions of the color blue or whether this claim asserts that the sky is always blue. The missing details are usually called "context" but for an informal language, it is not possible to provide all the context for a <a href="#vanity-73656e74656e6365" class="vanity-term-link">sentence</a> to become unambiguous. What prevents this is how each <a href="#vanity-6d696e64" class="vanity-term-link">mind</a> produces <a href="#vanity-636f6e63657074" class="vanity-term-link">concepts</a> and reacts to them as a function of its own state rather than just as a function of new external data.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-666f726d616c206c616e6775616765"></span><strong>formal language</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A formal language is a <a href="#vanity-6c616e6775616765" class="vanity-term-link">language</a> defined mathematically, or equivalently unambiguously. Most programming languages can be thought of as formal languages, even if in practice certain aspects of the language are left undefined. Another example of "almost formal" languages are mathematical proofs. While ordinary mathematical proofs are expressed in a natural language such as English, they are believed to be translatable into one or more equivalent proof-checking <a href="#vanity-616c676f726974686d" class="vanity-term-link">algorithms</a> by different people. Since not everyone understands a given mathematical proof, the key is to convince the audience that they understand the proof only if they really do. As a shortcut, we might therefore allow ourselves to treat most mathematical discourse as using a formal language. This contrasts with everyday <a href="#vanity-696e666f726d616c206c616e6775616765" class="vanity-term-link">informal languages</a>, which are not believed nor designed to be unambiguous.</span></p>

A mind makes <a href="#vanity-6465636973696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">decisions</a> at least partially by relying on some internal structure in the <a href="#vanity-73797374656d" class="vanity-term-link">system</a>, without relying on a <a href="#vanity-73796d626f6c" class="vanity-term-link">symbolism</a> or language that makes it transferable to other <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individuals</a>.

<p><span id="vanity-756e6465727374616e64696e67"></span><strong>understanding</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">(1) Some measure of how much a <a href="#vanity-6d696e64" class="vanity-term-link">mind</a> reproduces <a href="#vanity-696d706c69636974206d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">implicitly</a> the essential features of some external <a href="#vanity-6d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">model</a>. It can be tested by placing the mind in an <a href="#vanity-656e7669726f6e6d656e74" class="vanity-term-link">environment</a> that requires quick <a href="#vanity-6465636973696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">decisions</a> that benefit from identifying features of the model without much <a href="#vanity-636f6d7075746174696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">computation</a>.

<p><span id="vanity-636f6d6d756e69636174696f6e"></span><strong>communication</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">Transfer of <a href="#vanity-636f6e63657074" class="vanity-term-link">concepts</a> from an <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individual</a> to other individuals. A concept is the activation of a construct within a particular <a href="#vanity-6d696e64" class="vanity-term-link">mind</a>. In general and ideally, two individuals with similar experience and exposed to the same input will activate approximately equivalent concepts. For example, when seeing an apple, some kind of neuron may light up, corresponding to the approximately defined concept of "an apple being present in front of them". We distinguish concepts, which are internal to each mind, from <a href="#vanity-73796d626f6c" class="vanity-term-link">symbols</a> which are placeholders meant to activate, trigger, or elicit a particular concept. Communication may or may not rely on symbols. <a href="#vanity-6c616e6775616765" class="vanity-term-link">Language</a> relies on symbols to represent concepts. An example of communication without symbols is teaching by example, such as an animal showing their offspring how to catch prey by just doing it.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-7461626f6f"></span><strong>taboo</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A <a href="#vanity-636f6e63657074" class="vanity-term-link">concept</a> that is being avoided by one or more <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individuals</a>. Keeping in mind that a concept is the activation of a particular state of the <a href="#vanity-6d696e64" class="vanity-term-link">mind</a>, avoiding a concept is a complex process. It takes the mind some training that consists in identifying situations that may lead to the concept, and favoring <a href="#vanity-6465636973696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">decisions</a> that take the focus away from the taboo concept. It is important to distinguish a taboo from any undesirable situation. A taboo concept is not just about avoiding a specific situation but also avoiding thinking about it. For example, the concept "a tiger is attacking me" for most people is not taboo because we don't have a problem imagining this. The actual concept that we want to avoid is "the tiger is attacking me right now for real". A taboo is a concept that is completely avoided, possibly due to threats <a href="#vanity-636f6d6d756e69636174696f6e" class="vanity-term-link">communicated</a> by others or more generally due to fear caused by <a href="#vanity-666565646261636b" class="vanity-term-link">negative</a> past experience involving co-occurring concepts.</span></p>
