<p>This is an attempt to construct a dictionary of various terms which I consider important and unambiguous in my view of the world. Emphasis is placed on simplicity, consistency, and approachability. This document is meant to evolve on a continuous basis rather than being the subject of official releases.</p>
<p><span id="vanity-776f726c64"></span><strong>world</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A subject of study plus everything that interacts with it directly or indirectly. It is normally referred to as "the" world because it is everything that exists. There is no mathematical definition for it. Referring to multiple worlds or to "a" world is an abuse of language indicating a model of the world that is made up of multiple independent models.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-6d6f64656c"></span><strong>model</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">An unambiguous representation of the <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a>. As such, a model can in principle be translated into another language and recovered back without loss. A model is necessarily simpler than the world in which it can be expressed.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-74696d65"></span><strong>time</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">An ordering over the states of a <a href="#vanity-6d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">model</a>. Time is the breakdown of a model into a sequence of objects called states with constraints over those states. A more specific definition of time is part of each model, if the model relies on such notion of time or successive states. Unless otherwise specified, the stepwise execution of computer programs uses a discrete, nonnegative index t to reference the successive steps of a computation. An ideal scenario is a computation of discrete states starting from an initial state t = 0 and a transition function. The transition function computes the next state from the previous one. Such computations are called simulations. More generally however, when there is no need for computing successive states, time is usually modeled as the real line.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-696e646976696475616c"></span><strong>individual</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">In a <a href="#vanity-6d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">model</a> of the <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a>, an individual is a mutable entity which interacts with the rest of world, including other individuals. Each individual exists for some continuous period of <a href="#vanity-74696d65" class="vanity-term-link">time</a>, usually in a binary fashion: at a given time, the individual either exists or doesn't exist.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-6172746966696369616c"></span><strong>artificial</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">The property of being created by <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individuals</a>, as opposed to being imposed by the <a href="#vanity-6d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">model</a> of the <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a> in which the individuals exist.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-6964656e74697479"></span><strong>identity</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">The collection of properties associated with an <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individual</a>.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-736574"></span><strong>set</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A set as defined in mathematics by the axioms of set theory.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-72756c65"></span><strong>rule</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">An <a href="#vanity-6172746966696369616c" class="vanity-term-link">artificial</a> constraint. Unlike a physical constraint which can apply to various portions of a model, an artificial constraint applies to <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individual</a> members of a society, and said members can decide whether to follow it.</span></p>
<p><span id="vanity-736f6369657479"></span><strong>society</strong>: <span class="vanity-contents">A <a href="#vanity-736574" class="vanity-term-link">set</a> of <a href="#vanity-696e646976696475616c" class="vanity-term-link">individuals</a> known as society members within a <a href="#vanity-6d6f64656c" class="vanity-term-link">model</a> of the <a href="#vanity-776f726c64" class="vanity-term-link">world</a>, and associated with <a href="#vanity-72756c65" class="vanity-term-link">rules</a>.</span></p>
