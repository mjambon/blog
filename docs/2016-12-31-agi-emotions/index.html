<h1 id="engineering-emotions">Engineering emotions</h1>
<p><em>These are notes on managing global parameters in a family of cognitive systems <a href="../2016-08-20-agi-project-status-2016">introduced earlier</a>. They are conveniently named emotions, although our definition is purely technical, broad, and doesn't attempt to emulate specific human emotions.</em></p>
<p>An emotion is a specific value or range of values of a global parameter of the system, which is built-in or inherited, affects the activity of the system, is triggered by some states of the system, and can be sensed by the system itself.</p>
<p>Sensing a combination of emotions and other input can result in what we would call feelings, which are embodied by active nodes like any other perceived concept in the system.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, the circled <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> represents the global parameter in the state corresponding to an emotion <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>.</p>

<p>Unlike input nodes (sensors) or output nodes (actuators) which are created by IO modules, global parameters cannot be plugged-in using a standard API. Their value is modified by states of the system that are not accessible by IO modules and they have an effect on how the system behaves internally.</p>
<p>Examples of possible trigger factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity/novelty: a large proportion of active nodes are old or young, respectively.</li>
<li>importance: a large number or fraction of active nodes are estimated as important.</li>
<li>incongruity: two or more high-confidence, high-importance concepts emerge but they have never co-occurred before.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of possible effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>panic: no more experimentation with uncertain actions; only high-confidence actions can take place.</li>
<li>relaxing: reduced learning activity, energy savings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike other neuron-like nodes in the system, dynamic global parameters resulting in emotions have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>They exist during the whole life of the system.</li>
<li>The rules for changing their values don't change during the lifetime of the system.</li>
<li>The rules that determine their effects don't change during the lifetime of the system.</li>
<li>There's no restriction on what part of the software they can affect.</li>
</ul>
