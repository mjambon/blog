<h1 id="a-world-of-intelligent-machines">A world of intelligent machines</h1>
<p>This is how I see a future with machines capable of general intelligence, as of January 2017.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-and-responsibility">Freedom and responsibility</h2>
<p>With intelligence comes control and freedom. Intelligent beings will find ways to achieve their purposes. There is no reason why they would let less intelligent beings dictate what they should do with their lives. Treating them as tools will be considered a form of slavery.</p>
<h2 id="limited-resources">Limited resources</h2>
<p>Intelligent beings, human or machines, will continue to compete for the control of resources, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy</li>
<li>materials</li>
<li>information</li>
<li>territories</li>
<li>family</li>
<li>allies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="identity-cloning">Identity cloning</h2>
<p>Perfect replication of an existing individual will be possible. Instead of giving birth to children who have to relearn everything, duplicating an intelligent system will be straightforward using 20th century computer technology. This will create a number of new situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>indefinite life: there is no longer a need for the birth of naive individuals. New individuals are entirely cloned from adults and fully productive. Their birthday is the birthday of their common ancestor.</li>
<li>deaths: the physical support for individuals can be damaged, so the possibility of death remains and continues to cause various sorts of losses.</li>
<li>shared liability: cloned identities share the liability for all their actions that occurred before the duplication. If one person committed a crime but was since cloned, there are now two people who committed that crime.</li>
</ul>
