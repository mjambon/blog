<p>This article presents a heuristic for mapping a real-valued random signal that follows an arbitrary distribution to a uniform distribution over <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. It’s based on maintaining <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins, each representing an equal slice of the distribution. The average values of the bins are used to define a piecewise linear mapping from the original distribution to the uniform distribution. The result is a function that normalizes any input signal onto <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. It also has the ability to adjust to changes in the distribution over time. A usage scenario is the normalization of ratings given by a particular judge into scores that can be compared from one judge to another, regardless of how harsh or generous the judges are.</p>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins, the amortized cost of adding a sample to the model is <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> and the cost of normalizing an input sample is <span class="math inline">\(O(\log n)\)</span> as well.</p>
<h1 id="problem"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Problem</h1>
<p>We are concerned with the practical problem of normalizing ratings from an external source into consistent scores with a universal meaning. An external source might be a human assigning some sort of ratings or feedback, using a subjective scale. We would like to normalize those ratings such that their value has the same meaning,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>regardless of the distribution of the original ratings from a particular source, and</li>
<li>regardless of changes in the distribution over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The meaning of a score shall be its normalized rank or percentile, expressed as a value in the range <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>. For example, if 23% of the input ratings are below 8.5 and the remaining 77% of ratings are above 8.5, then the normalized score for 8.5 is 0.23. Our goal is to build a function that takes input ratings and maps them to such normalized score. Input ratings are used in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>to build a model of the distribution of the input signal;</li>
<li>to be mapped into a normalized score using the modeled distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article focuses on the main idea behind the solution. The more tedious work such as the initialization phase or handling interpolation at the extremities of the distribution is published as part of the source code for our implementation.</p>
<h1 id="solution-outline"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Solution outline</h1>
<p>Given a stream of input numbers, we have to build and maintain some data structure that models the input distribution, which we call the distribution tracker. We add new samples to the tracker in order to initialize or update the model. We also want to be able to obtain a normalized score by passing in a sample input without necessarily updating the tracker. This is summarized by the following OCaml interface:</p>
<pre><code>type tracker
val add : tracker -&gt; float -&gt; unit
val normalize : tracker -&gt; float -&gt; float

(* Combine &#39;add&#39; and &#39;normalize&#39;. *)
val map : tracker -&gt; float -&gt; float</code></pre>
<h2 id="distribution-tracking"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Distribution tracking</h2>
<p>The algorithm uses two main parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the number within (0, 1) used in the computation of an exponential moving average (EMA) for each bin;</li>
<li>a number of bins <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, each representing an equal slice of the distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>A distribution tracker is made of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> bins, each of which tracks an EMA. Updating the tracker is done by batches of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> input samples. The algorithm is the following:</p>
<pre><code>for i in 0 ... n - 1:
  acc[i] &lt;- read_number()

sort(acc)

for i in 0 ... n - 1:
  update_ema(ema[i], acc[i])</code></pre>
<p>As is, this algorithm requires <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples before the <code>ema</code> array could be initialized. Then it can be used to normalize any input sample.</p>
<p>In practice, we’d like to start normalizing samples on the fly, before seeing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples. This is done during the initialization phase by sorting the array, whose length is <span class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, right after adding each sample. This shorter array can then be used in place of the normal array of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for normalizing some input. Once this initialization phase is over, we sort the accumulator <code>acc</code> normally, just once every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples.</p>
<h2 id="normalization"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Normalization</h2>
<p>The <code>ema</code> array provides <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> averages derived from input samples, which are guaranteed to be sorted in increasing order. Given an input sample to normalize, the two nearest bins are identified by some variant of binary search.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sample lies between the values of the two bins, simple linear interpolation is performed.</li>
<li>If the sample falls outside of the interval defined by the two bins, i.e. it is lower than the value in bin 0 or greater than the value in bin <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>, then a more complex treatment is applied, so as to prevent the normalized result from falling outside <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For accurate, tested algorithms, please refer to the OCaml implementation.</p>
<h1 id="results"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Results</h1>
<p>The <code>uniformize</code> program was used to apply the <code>map</code> function to each input sample.</p>
<p>The following input signal was generated:</p>
<p><a href="img/input.png"
   title="Click to enlarge"><img
     src="img/input.png"
     alt="Distribution of the sample input data"/></a></p>
<p>The samples are picked randomly using:</p>
<ul>
<li>The same exponential distribution at the beginning for samples <span class="math inline">\([0, 199]\)</span> and at the end for samples <span class="math inline">\([1000, 1999]\)</span>.</li>
<li>A shifting distribution was used for samples <span class="math inline">\([200, 999]\)</span>, as visible on the graph so as to see how our normalizer reacts to changes in the distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n = 20\)</span>, the results look as follows:</p>
<p><a href="img/output.png"
   title="Click to enlarge"><img
     src="img/output.png"
     alt="Distribution of the sample output data"/></a></p>
<p>Normalization appears to give reasonable results fairly quickly from the beginning, as long as the distribution remains the same. However, it takes about 600 samples to recover from the changes in distribution once it stops changing (from sample 1000 to around 1600).</p>
