<p>Many of these rules are highly counter-intuitive to inexperienced programmers and engineering managers. Use responsibly. üôÇ</p>
<!-- toc -->
<h1 data-number="1" id="tell-us-why-we-need-that-code" data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Tell us why we need that code</h1>
<p>Rule: When producing a piece of code of any size, make sure it comes with a concise explanation of <em>why</em> it has to exist.</p>
<p>Answers to the following questions must be obvious to a naive reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who or what needs it?</li>
<li>What is it for? Where can I learn more about it?</li>
<li>Why not use an existing library?</li>
<li>What does it depend on? How much maintenance will be needed?</li>
<li>Who understands it best?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start <em>all</em> source files with at least <em>some</em> description of where they fit in the project.</li>
<li>Use evocative names.</li>
<li>Have a short, low-maintenance readme for each component of the project.</li>
<li>Describe the intent behind a long function.</li>
<li>Leave notes about room for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigability: Outsiders can quickly locate things by reading the project description, then find the right component, then find the right file, then find the right function.</li>
<li>Debuggability: We can‚Äôt fix it if we don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs supposed to do.</li>
<li>History: Contributors come and go. Finding a brain dump of the original author saves the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lengthy reconstruction: A new contributor has to guess what the existing code does without knowing its structure. Not knowing what is part of a grand design and what was meant to be improved is challenging. Sometimes it is even faster to throw the whole project away and start a fresh implementation. Any of this is costly.</li>
<li>Bugs: New contributors start making changes without understanding their implications. Bad code piles up. New contributors are hired to keep up with maintenance.</li>
<li>10x programmers are born. The infamous ‚Äú10x programmer‚Äù is one who delivers inscrutable code at a fast rate. They leave other contributors puzzled and unable to extend it or fix it. Team productivity tanks.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="dont-break-my-focus" data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Don‚Äôt break my focus</h1>
<p>Rule: It‚Äôs fine to interrupt a programmer only for things that don‚Äôt require them to focus on something else. For everything else, use asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>Examples: Interrupting someone to ask for their home address is usually ok. Interrupting someone to ask them what they think of a piece of code is not acceptable.</p>
<p>If followed: Programmer gets their job done.</p>
<p>If not followed: 30 minutes are needed to refocus after each interruption.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="supervisor-could-fill-in-for-me" data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Supervisor could fill in for me</h1>
<p>Rule: The programmer‚Äôs supervisor, if any, must be able to take over the programmer‚Äôs job were they to leave the team.</p>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmer can take a vacation, get sick, leave, etc. without complications.</li>
<li>Supervisor can evaluate their work.</li>
<li>Supervisor can create the correct incentives for shaping the team‚Äôs productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisor hires and fires the wrong people.</li>
<li>Supervisor cannot provide adequate tools and a productive environment.</li>
<li>Supervisor cannot settle conflicts.</li>
<li>Supervisor is useless as a supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="eliminate"></a></p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="eliminate-future-tasks" data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Eliminate future tasks</h1>
<p>Rule: If the programmer can eliminate future work for themselves or for their peers, they should take the time to do so.</p>
<p>It is important that the manager sees this as well and supports such unscheduled tasks. See also the ‚Äú<a href="#deadlines">No deadlines</a>‚Äù rule.</p>
<p>Example: Take a month to create a tool that will eliminate two years of work across the team.</p>
<p><a name="deadlines"></a></p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="no-deadlines" data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> No deadlines</h1>
<p>Rule: Eliminate deadlines as much as possible.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don‚Äôt skip opportunities for automation due to the pressure to stick to a schedule. See also the ‚Äú<a href="#eliminate">Eliminate future tasks</a>‚Äù rule.</li>
<li>Keep things running smoothly by investing in occasional refactoring work. It should be done before the code base becomes too messy so as to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling the frog</a>. Such work typically has no visible impact on the product. This is why it requires understanding and support from management.</li>
</ul>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased productivity.</li>
<li>Low stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much code piles up, needs maintenance.</li>
<li>Low productivity due to lack of clean-up efforts.</li>
<li>Team spends time fixing bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="6" id="consistent-incentives" data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Consistent incentives</h1>
<p>Rule: Managers must set incentives consistently with best software engineering practices. They must identify and eliminate counter-productive incentives.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage code quality over quantity.</li>
<li>Encourage selfless efforts.</li>
<li>Encourage initiative.</li>
<li>Reward automation proportionally to cost savings.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="7" id="zero-effort-build" data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Zero-effort build</h1>
<p>Rule: Any project can be built, tested, and deployed without thinking.</p>
<p>Example: A project is trivially built, tested, and installed with the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make</code></li>
<li><code>make test</code></li>
<li><code>make install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Any deviation from this scheme adds to the cognitive burden of the person who needs to build the project.</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="routine-build-under-2-minutes" data-number="8"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Routine build under 2 minutes</h1>
<p>Rule: A routine <code>make</code> invocation should be short enough for the developer to <em>not lose focus</em>. This is 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the developer loses focus and starts looking at other things. Prevent that context switch.</p>
<p>If followed: No interruptions. Happiness. Things get done fast.</p>
<p>If not followed: Developer has to wait 5 minutes for their code to compile or pass tests. They go and check their email or company chat. Or maybe they go get coffee or a snack. The 5-min break turns into a 15-min or 30-min break. Employee gets back to their desk and needs to refocus. This adds another 5-10 minutes. In the end, it‚Äôs a series 20-min to 40-min breaks interleaved with 10-20 minutes of coding. Nothing gets done fast. Programmer gets sad.</p>
<h1 data-number="9" id="accountability-for-technical-choices" data-number="9"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Accountability for technical choices</h1>
<p>Rule: Let the programmer choose their tools and hold them accountable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúA good craftsman never blames his tools‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because he gets to choose them!</p>
<p>What if they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmers choose what makes them more productive in their specialty.</li>
<li>Programmers stand by their work.</li>
<li>Manager doesn‚Äôt have to be an expert at everything.</li>
<li>Manager is trusted and loved.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if they don‚Äôt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager is not an expert, chooses inadequate or obsolete tools.</li>
<li>Programmers are unproductive.</li>
<li>Programmers get frustrated.</li>
<li>Manager gets frustrated.</li>
<li>Manager gets disrespected.</li>
<li>Nobody really owns successes or failures.</li>
<li>Team members stop caring.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="10" id="group-culture-sticks" data-number="10"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Group culture sticks</h1>
<p>Rule: Don‚Äôt change a culture, replace it.</p>
<p>The culture of a group of people never shifts progressively to a different culture. You can only leave the group, join another group, or start a new group. A culture is defined by a set of behaviors. When these behaviors get in the way of effective software engineering, the group will fail rather than change.</p>
<p>This is why acqui-hires, i.e.¬†the hiring of a successful group of workers, is valuable to large companies. By joining as a group, these workers hopefully keep doing things the way they used to, instead of adopting the unsuccessful practices of the hiring company.</p>
<h1 data-number="11" id="dont-do-what-you-dont-understand" data-number="11"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Don‚Äôt do what you don‚Äôt understand</h1>
<p>Rule: If you don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for and why it should work, don‚Äôt use it. Drop it. This applies to rules, tools, methods, and processes at all levels of an organization.</p>
<p>Of course, this applies to the rules mentioned in this article! Don‚Äôt apply them if they‚Äôre not justified in your situation.</p>
<p>Justification: Shallow imitation or ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo cult</a>‚Äù comes at a cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn‚Äôt produce the expected results</li>
<li>Wastes time</li>
<li>Weakens initiatives that really matter</li>
</ul>
