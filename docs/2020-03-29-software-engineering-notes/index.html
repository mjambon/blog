<p>These are a few rules I like, drawn from my experience. Like all good rules, they’re really just guidelines. Nothing’s set in stone. Execution is what matters.</p>
<!-- toc -->
<h1 data-number="1" id="tell-us-why-we-need-that-code" data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Tell us why we need that code</h1>
<p>Rule: When producing a piece of code of any size, make sure it comes with a concise explanation of why it has to exist. Answers to the following questions must be obvious to a naive reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who or what needs it?</li>
<li>What is it for? Where can I learn more about it if necessary?</li>
<li>Couldn’t we do with an existing library?</li>
<li>What does it depend on? How much maintenance will be needed?</li>
<li>Who understands it best?</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start <em>all</em> source files with at least <em>some</em> description of where they fit in the project.</li>
<li>Use evocative names.</li>
<li>Have a short, low-maintenance readme for each component of the project.</li>
<li>Describe the intent behind a non-trivial function.</li>
<li>Leave notes about code weaknesses and things that may need more work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigability: readers not familiar with the project can quickly find what they’re looking for, by reading the project description, then finding the right component, then finding the right file, then finding the right function.</li>
<li>Debuggability: it’s hard to fix a piece of code if we don’t know what it’s supposed to do.</li>
<li>Memory: contributors come and go, whether it was originally intended or not. A brain dump of the original author can be passed to the future generations of maintainers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lengthy reconstruction: a new contributor has to guess what the existing code does without knowing its structure. Not knowing what is part of a grand design and what was meant to be improved is challenging. Sometimes it is even faster to throw the whole project away and start a fresh implementation. Any of this is costly.</li>
<li>Bugs: new contributors start making changes without understanding their implications. Bad code piles up. New contributors are hired to keep up with maintenance.</li>
<li>10x programmers are born. The now infamous “10x programmer” is one who delivers inscrutable code at a fast rate. They leave other contributors puzzled and unable to extend it or fix it. Team productivity tanks.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="dont-break-my-focus" data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Don’t break my focus</h1>
<p>Rule: It’s ok to interrupt a programmer only for things that don’t require them to focus on something else. For everything else, use asynchronous communication.</p>
<p>Examples: Interrupting someone to ask for their home address is usually ok. Interrupting someone to ask them what they think of a piece of code is not acceptable.</p>
<p>If followed: Programmer gets their job done.</p>
<p>If not followed: 30 minutes are needed to refocus after each interruption.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="supervisor-could-fill-in-for-me" data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Supervisor could fill in for me</h1>
<p>Rule: The programmer’s supervisor, if any, must be able to take over the programmer’s job were they to leave the team.</p>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmer can take a vacation, get sick, leave, etc. without complications.</li>
<li>Supervisor can evaluate their work.</li>
<li>Supervisor can create the correct incentives for shaping the team’s productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisor hires and fires the wrong people.</li>
<li>Supervisor cannot provide adequate tools and a productive environment.</li>
<li>Supervisor cannot settle conflicts.</li>
<li>Supervisor is useless as a supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="eliminate"></a></p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="eliminate-future-tasks" data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Eliminate future tasks</h1>
<p>Rule: If the programmer can eliminate future work for themselves or for their peers, they should take the time to do so. It is important that the manager sees this as well and supports such unscheduled tasks. See also the “<a href="#deadlines">No deadlines</a>” rule.</p>
<p>Example: Take a month to create a tool that will eliminate two years of work across the team.</p>
<p><a name="deadlines"></a></p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="no-deadlines" data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> No deadlines</h1>
<p>Rule: Eliminate deadlines as much as possible.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities for automating the team’s tasks should not be missed due to the pressure to stick to a schedule. See also the “<a href="#eliminate">Eliminate future tasks</a>” rule.</li>
<li>Occasional refactoring work must be undertaken to keep things running smoothly. It should be done before the code base becomes too messy so as to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling the frog</a>. Such work typically has no visible impact on the product. This is why it requires understanding and support from management.</li>
</ul>
<p>If followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased productivity.</li>
<li>Low stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much code piles up, needs maintenance.</li>
<li>Low productivity due to lack of clean-up efforts.</li>
<li>Team spends time fixing bugs.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="6" id="consistent-incentives" data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Consistent incentives</h1>
<p>Rule: Managers must set incentives consistent with best software engineering practices. They must identify and eliminate counter-productive incentives.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage code quality over quantity.</li>
<li>Encourage selfless efforts.</li>
<li>Encourage initiative.</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="7" id="zero-effort-build" data-number="7"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Zero-effort build</h1>
<p>Rule: Any project or subproject can be built, tested, and deployed without thinking.</p>
<p>Example: A project is trivially built, tested, and installed with the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make</code></li>
<li><code>make test</code></li>
<li><code>make install</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Any deviation from this scheme adds to the cognitive burden of the person who needs to build the project.</p>
<h1 data-number="8" id="routine-build-under-3-minutes" data-number="8"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Routine build under 3 minutes</h1>
<p>Rule: A routine <code>make</code> invocation may take no more than 3 minutes. Or whatever time allows the developer to stay focused and not start checking their email or other distractions.</p>
<p>If followed: No interruptions. Happiness. Things get done fast.</p>
<p>If not followed: Developer has to wait 5 minutes for their code to compile or pass tests. They go and check their email or company chat. Or maybe they go get coffee, or lunch. The 5-min break turns into a 15-min or 30-min break. Employee gets back to their desk and needs to refocus. This adds another 5-10 minutes. In the end, it’s a series 20-min to 40-min breaks interleaved with 10-20 minutes of coding. Nothing gets done fast. Programmer gets sad.</p>
<h1 data-number="9" id="accountability-for-technical-choices" data-number="9"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Accountability for technical choices</h1>
<p>Rule: Let the programmer choose their tools and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>What if they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmers choose what makes them more productive in their specialty.</li>
<li>Programmers stand by their work.</li>
<li>Manager doesn’t have to be an expert at everything.</li>
<li>Manager is trusted and loved.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if they don’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manager is not an expert, chooses inadequate or obsolete tools.</li>
<li>Programmers are unproductive.</li>
<li>Programmers get frustrated.</li>
<li>Manager gets frustrated.</li>
<li>Manager gets disrespected.</li>
<li>Nobody really owns successes or failures.</li>
<li>Team members stop caring.</li>
</ul>
