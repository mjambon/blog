<h2 id="artificial-cognition">Artificial cognition</h2>
<p>In my personal time, I develop theories and software for creating machines that will live their own lives and take care of themselves. The emphasis is on developing a general form of proto-intelligence first, and not any specific application. This endeavor is more of an art project than an industrial project, as ultimately it is about creating artificial individuals, not tools.</p>
<p>The implementation of the <a href="2016-08-20-agi-project-status-2016">architecture laid out in 2016</a> is still ongoing as of 2020. It is now closed-source.</p>

<p>These original ideas come with some implementation that works, but aren’t widely known or used by many. Work would be needed to publicize them or make them widely accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjambon/vanity">vanity</a> (2020): Validation and formatting of acyclic dictionaries. The goal is to allow thinkers to present their respective world views in a concise and unambiguous manner, without resorting to mathematical formalism.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjambon/purple-fringe">unpurple</a> (2012): An algorithm for removing purple-fringe defects from photos. Now available to all in GIMP via G’MIC.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjambon/dutop">dutop</a> (2011): A command for identifying the subtrees which take up the most space in a file system. Typically used when running into “no space left on device” errors.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjambon/wcl">wcl</a> (2011): A command for estimating the number of lines of large files. Useful when dealing routinely with 100,000,000 records or more.</li>

<p>These tools have been or were used professionally by multiple independent users. They were all initiated by me, with or without support from an employer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ahrefs/atd">atd</a> (2010): Code generator for making JSON pleasant and flexible to use with OCaml. Comes with its own type definition language designed to be adaptable to various data formats and programming languages.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-community/yojson">yojson</a> (2010): JSON parsers supporting atd. Turned out to be widely used as is by many OCaml users.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ocaml-community/cppo">cppo</a> (2009): Straightforward C-style preprocessor for OCaml. Used typically as a last resort to deal with compatibility issues across different versions of libraries.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mjambon/mikmatch">mikmatch</a> (2004, defunct): extension of OCaml’s ML-style pattern-matching syntax with regexps. Was based on Camlp4 which since has fallen from grace.</li>

<h2 id="structural-bioinformatics-2000-2007">Structural bioinformatics (2000-2007)</h2>
<p>For my PhD and postdoc, I worked on tools to study the 3D structure of proteins. While my postdoc experience wasn’t a thrill scientifically speaking, I some moderate success with my PhD work in France.</p>
<p>The SuMo project (2000-2003) was an attempt to identify local similarities among unrelated 3D structures of proteins, in the hope that they would share a similar biological function.</p>
<p>This involved complex heuristics for somewhat limited results. It permanently convinced me that a system capable of forming its own intuition about the behavior of proteins would be the key to solving this problem, and many others.</p>
<p>In the process, I became a scientific poster enthusiast. Here’s an example of my creations, which I presented at an international conference in 2005:</p>
